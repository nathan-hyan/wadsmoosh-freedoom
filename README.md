# WadSmoosh - simple IWAD merge utility

WadSmoosh merges your provided Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, Master Levels, No Rest for the Living, Final Doom, and Sigil data into a single IWAD file that can be played in GZDoom, with each game as its own entry in the episode list. This makes it very convenient to play all of classic Doom's official releases without relaunching the game with different settings.

It's fine if you don't have all of the Doom games, eg you have Doom 2 but not Final Doom - WadSmoosh will package up everything it can find.

If you're not a Doom expert and just bought these games off [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/18397/) etc, see the **Absolute Beginner's Guide** section below.

## Usage

Simply copy all your WADs into the `source_wads/` subfolder, then run WadSmoosh. A log will appear showing progress and any errors that arise.

If you're in Windows, click `wadsmoosh.exe`.

If you're in macOS or Linux, run the `wadsmoo.sh` shell script - Python 2 and 3 are both supported now.

WadSmoosh will create a new file called `doom_complete.pk3` with all the game content in it. You can run this in GZDoom with `-iwad doom_complete.pk3` at the command line, or even rename it to `doom2.wad` and run without any command line needed. GZDoom 2.4 and later will recognize the `doom_complete.pk3` file as a valid IWAD without any name change needed.

If you've extracted the No Rest for the Living addon episode for Doom 2 from Doom 3: BFG Edition or the PSN or XBLA versions, make sure it's named `nerve.wad` in the `source_wads/` folder.

In rare cases, you may need to uncheck the `source_wads/` folder's read-only status.

Advanced users can edit `wadsmoosh_data.py` to customize how and what WadSmoosh extracts. This file is Python code, read by the main program at runtime, so no recompile is required. You can also customize the ordering of the Master Levels by running WadSmoosh from the command line with a text file defining the ordering as an extra parameter. The ["Xaser ordering"](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?p=634600#p634600) is the default, but `masterlevels_order.txt` provides the mostly-alphabetical "PSN ordering", and more info on this customization option is included in comments at the top of that file. This is the only configuration option that WadSmoosh supports, and in general I'm opposed to adding more such options without turning WadSmoosh into a full-on GUI program.

## FreeDoom support

Download Freedoom for Free in [this link](https://freedoom.github.io/download.html)

This fork enables the support for both Freedoom Phase 1 and 2 maps, music and *NEW* textures. It does not use the sprites nor the Doom-replacing textures since they will use the original ones. (I might add support for them in a future release but it's not on my to-do list right now.)

The current To-do list is:

    - Add the music for Freedoom Phase 1
    - Add the intermission screens for Phase 1 and 2 (Graphics and Texts)
    - Add the map credits into the MAPINFO lump (the map names that are in there are from DOOM 1's lump file)
    - Try to fix any gameplay issue / missing texture. Haven't found any yet

## Absolute Beginner's Guide

1. [Download WadSmoosh](https://jp.itch.io/wadsmoosh) and extract it to a folder.
2. Find the folder(s) where Steam/GoG installed your game(s). For Steam, this will be something like `<Steam folder>\SteamApps\Common\<game name>\base`.
3. Copy any files you find with a `.WAD` extension to the `source_wads/` subfolder where you extracted WadSmoosh.
4. Double-click `wadsmoosh.exe`. A console window will pop up to show progress.
5. When it closes, you should have a file in the WadSmoosh folder called `doom_complete.pk3`.
6. Download [GZDoom](http://gzdoom.drdteam.org) and extract it to a folder.
7. Copy the `doom_complete.pk3` file to GZDoom's folder.
8. Launch GZDoom and play!
